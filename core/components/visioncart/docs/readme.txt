If you have BETA-2 or newer, just install this update over your current installation.

Afterwards you can follow the templating tutorial: 
http://rtfm.modx.com/display/ADDON/VisionCart.Templating

If you have installed the first beta, uninstall it PRIOR to installing this version!
Please check that you have removed:

- The package (by uninstalling it)
- Dropped all the tables
- The default installed VisionCart template*
- The default installed resources*

(* = you can leave these as well, but they won't get update as they do not belong to
the default package anymore)

You should be able to update from beta2 to this one safely but just to make
sure: MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR FILES.

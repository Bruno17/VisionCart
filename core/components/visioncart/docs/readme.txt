If you have installed the first beta, uninstall it PRIOR to installing this version!
Please check that you have removed:

- The package (by uninstalling it)
- Dropped all the tables
- The default installed VisionCart template*
- The default installed resources*

(* = you can leave these as well, but they won't get update as they do not belong to
the default package anymore)

From this version on the package is updatable through the package manager. This is 
because we did some dirty manual work in the first beta that doesn't get removed
by just uninstalling it.

VisionCart is provided "as is". We are not responsible for any damage or loss you or 
your company suffers by using VisionCart. When you click the next button, you take all
responsibility for using this package.

VisionCart is developed and maintained by 1-vision (http://www.1-vision.nl)
